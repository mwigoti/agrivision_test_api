  "analysis": "\n\nAs an agricultural scientist and soil specialist, I have analyzed the data provided and generated several actionable insights. Below are my top recommendations:\n\n1. Soil Health Assessment: Soil health is vital for long-term agricultural productivity. The analysis reveals that the soil texture, structure, nutrient content, and organic matter are all relatively healthy, with some areas of deficiency. The soil temperature and moisture are within optimal ranges, with the majority of the soil being moist. To improve soil health, consider implementing conservation tillage, applying organic fertilizers, and implementing precision ag practices.\n\n2. Climate Impact: The analysis indicates that the temperature and moisture conditions are generally favorable, with some areas of over-irrigation. This may cause soil degradation and reduced crop yields in the long term. To mitigate climate change, consider implementing water-saving measures and implementing climate-smart agriculture practices.\n\n3. Crop Recommendations: The analysis suggests planting wheat, corn, and soybeans for maximum yields. Additionally, the analysis highlights the importance of selecting the most suitable varieties for each crop. For example, planting 'Red River' wheat may increase yields, while 'Soybean 'MASTER' may be more susceptible to pests.\n\n4. Soil Plan: The analysis recommends applying nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, as well as lime to improve soil fertility. Additionally, conservation tillage and conservation crops can help preserve soil health.\n\n5. Risk & Mitigation: The analysis identifies pests and imbalances that could affect crop production. Implementing integrated pest management and crop rotation practices can help reduce these risks.\n\n6. Economics: The analysis suggests that implementing precision ag practices and precision irrigation can increase farm profitability. Additionally, considering the cost-effectiveness of conservation tillage and conservation crops can save farmers money in the long run.",
